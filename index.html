								<h2>From The Journal</h2>
								<p>If you find the oval shaped mirror laying around, you can use it to find the room where the ghost is most commonly found.
									Pick it up and activate it to peer into the spectral realm.<br />
									Careful: seeing into this realm will drain your sanity rapidly.</p>
								<div class="minimal">
									<h2>How To Use</h2>
									<p>The mirror must be toggled while inside. When activated, the haunted mirror will show a view of a part of the ghost room as a sweeping panorama, allowing players to locate the room by cross-reference. <br />
										If the users' sanity reaches zero, the mirror will break and start a cursed hunt near the users' position. </p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div id="music_hint" class="hidden">
								<h2>From The Journal</h2>
								<p>This intricate little music box has been created with the sole purpose of communicating with the dead.<br />
									Holding the box and activating it starts playing a spectral song, if you listen closely the ghost can sometimes be heard singing along to this haunting melody.<br />
									Don't get too close, you may interrupt its musical trance and anger it. </p>
								<div class="minimal">
									<h2>How To Use</h2>
									<p>A music box can be activated by holding it in the hand and using the secondary use key to activate the device. The music box can only be used once.<br />
										The music box will make the ghost sing along while being invisible, broadcasting its location. If the music box is 5 meters or less from the ghost, it will appear and start walking towards the box. If the ghost touches it, walks for more than 5 seconds, or the player drops the box while the tune is playing, it will start a cursed hunt. The music box can be handheld or put on the floor, the latter being the only safe way to discard the box without triggering a cursed hunt while it's playing.<br />
										The sanity will drop only if the player can hear the song.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div id="ouija_hint" class="hidden">
								<h2>From The Journal</h2>
								<p>These commonly found wooden boards can be used to communicate with ghosts. If you find one: activate it by placing down a planchette (a heart shaped wooden slate) and use your voice to ask a question.<br />
									Certain questions may lower your sanity more than others, especially if the ghost responds.</p>
								<div class="minimal">
									<h2>How To Use</h2>
									<p>Once activated, the planchette will appear, cancelling the setup phase if it is ongoing.<br />
										The player asking the question must have the Ouija Board inside the investigation area, as well as be inside to ask questions.<br />
										The Ouija Board does not have to be in the Ghost Room (nor the ghost's current room) to respond.<br />
										To deactivate the Ouija Board, the player must say "Goodbye", which will make the planchette disappear.<br />
										If the player who activated the board walks away from an active Ouija Board, or has insufficient sanity to "pay" for the question that they ask, the board will break itself up and trigger a cursed hunt.<br />

										<table>
											<tr><th>Question</th><th>Sanity Deduction</th></tr>
											<tr><td>Where are you?</td><td>50%</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Where is the bone?</td><td>50%</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Are you close?</td><td>20%</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Do you respond to everyone?&nbsp;</td><td>20%</td></tr>
											<tr><td>How old are you?</td><td>5%</td></tr>
											<tr><td>What is my sanity?</td><td>5%</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Others</td><td>5%</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Hide and seek</td><td>0% (cursed hunt)</td></tr>
										</table>

										If the question is recognised, the planchette will move to answer the question, and an EMF Level 2 reading will be generated around the Ouija Board.<br />
										If the ghost has EMF Level 5 as evidence, there is a 25% chance for this to be the reading instead.<br />
										The response chance is not affected by whether or not the ghost is shy.</p>

							<div id="circle_hint" class="hidden">
								<h2>From The Journal</h2>
								<p>Some locations have pentagrams drawn in blood, surrounded by blood red candles. Lighting all five candles will summon the ghost and trap it temporarily: perfect for taking photos.<br />
									Make sure you escape before the ghost breaks free.</p>
								<div class="minimal">
									<h2>How To Use</h2>
									<p>The summoning circle can be used by lighting all five red candles with a lighter.<br />
										Each candle deducts 16% sanity, leading to a total of 80% sanity being deducted for all candles.<br />
										Once all five candles are lit, the ghost will be summoned and fully-materialized, and stay motionless for 5 seconds, unable to kill players. <br />
										After the 5 second "grace period", it will immediately initiate a cursed hunt on the spot. Once the summoning circle has been activated, it cannot be used again.<br /><br />

										If the circle is lit while a hunt is already ongoing, the ghost will be teleported to the middle of the circle, and the hunt will continue. </p>

								<h2>From The Journal</h2>
								<p>These mystical cards are the most intriguing item we've found during previous investigations.<br />
									Each deck contains ten random cards that all have different paranormal properties. When drawn, they can trigger different effects on the team and on any nearby ghost.<br />
									Whilst they can be useful, they can also have negative effects, such as: sanity drain, ghost attacks, and even death.<br />
									Many of these cards are still yet to be discovered, who knows what's possible?</p>
								<div class="minimal">
									<h2>How To Use</h2>
									<p>Each Tarot cards deck contains 10 randomly generated cards. There are various possible cards the player can draw from the deck, each having a unique effect on either the player or the ghost if it is nearby. After being used, each card will vanish in a colored flame that is dependent on its type. The cards must be drawn inside the investigation area for them to work.<br /><br />
										There are 10 possible cards that can be drawn. A single card type can appear more than once in the deck, and there are different percentages for each card to spawn.<br />
										<table>
											<tr><th>Card</th><th>Chance</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
											
									<tr><td>The Tower</td><td>20%</td><td>Causes an interaction and doubles ghost activity for 20 seconds.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>The Wheel of Fortune&nbsp;</td><td>20%</td><td>Either increases the player's sanity by 25% if it burns green or decreases it by 25% if it burns red.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>The Devil</td><td>10%</td><td>Triggers a Ghost Event.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>Death</td><td>10%</td><td>Triggers a cursed hunt.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>The Hermit</td><td>10%</td><td>Teleports the ghost back to its ghost room and traps it there for 1 minute.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>The Sun</td><td>5%</td><td>Restores sanity to 100%.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>The Moon</td><td>5%</td><td>Drops sanity to 0%.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>The Fool</td><td>5%</td><td>Appears as another card at first, before turning into The Fool just before it burns. This card does not have any effect on the player.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>The High Priestess</td><td>2%</td><td>Revives a randomly chosen dead player at their corpse. If no one is dead, it will revive the next person who dies.</td></tr>
									<tr><td>The Hanged Man</td><td>1%</td><td>Instantly kills the player.</td></tr>
								</table><br />

										There will only be one deck of tarot cards that will spawn should it spawn, and once all ten have been used, no more will be given to the player.</p>

							<div id="doll_hint" class="hidden">
								<h2>From The Journal</h2>
								<p>These eerie, cute dolls are known for causing harm to others.<br />
									Picking one up and activating it will force the ghost to interact with the environment. Pins are chosen at random, and certain pins seem to affect you more than it effects the ghost.</p>
								<div class="minimal">
									<h2>How To Use</h2>
									<p>Interacting with the voodoo doll will cause one of the 10 pins stuck in the doll to be pushed into it at random.<br />
										This will cause the ghost to perform an interaction, and will drop the player's sanity by 5%. If the heart pin is pressed down, it will instead initiate a cursed hunt and drop the player's sanity by 10%.<br />
										If the player's sanity is less than what the pressed pin would drain, all of the remaining pins will get pushed in and a cursed hunt will occur. </p>
								</div>

							<div id="paw_hint" class="hidden">
								<h2>From The Journal</h2>
								<p>This mummified monkeys paw seems to grant a number of wishes depending on how many fingers are lifted when it's found.<br />
									It seems to be unique, compared to the other Cursed Possessions we've found, in that each wish has different consequences. Will you tamper with fate and change your future?</p>
								<div class="minimal">
									<h2>How To Use</h2>
									<p>The Monkey Paw can be used to grant the player wishes. Depending on the difficulty level, you'll get three to five wishes. You can't repeat the wish, so choose carefully.</p>
									<table style="border-spacing: 20px 2px; text-align: left;">
										<tr><th>Wish</th><th>Effect</th><th>Penalty</th></tr>
										<tr><td>I wish to be sane</td><td>The Sanity of all players is set to 50%.</td><td>Permanently 50% increased sanity drain. The Ghost's favorite room will be randomized.</td></tr>
										<tr><td>I wish to be safe</td><td>Unblocks the nearest hiding spot.</td><td>Ghost can permanently sense Player's voice and active electronics at any range.</td></tr>
										<tr><td>I wish to leave</td><td>Unlocks all doors.</td><td>Player is slowed and have reduced vision for 5 seconds.</td></tr>
										<tr><td>I wish to see the ghost</td><td>Ghost spawns near you for 5 seconds.</td><td>Cursed Hunt afterwards with reduced vision.</td></tr>
										<tr><td>I wish for activity</td><td>Doubled ghost activity for 2 minutes.</td><td>Permanently breaks the fuse box, and locks the exit door for two minutes.</td></tr>
										<tr><td>I wish to trap the ghost</td><td>Traps the ghost in the ghost room for 1 minute.</td><td>Player will be trapped in the room they are currently in for 1 minute. Cursed Hunt afterwards.</td></tr>
										<tr><td>I wish for life</td><td>Revive a dead teammate.</td><td>50% chance of killing the player who made the wish in turn.</td></tr>
										<tr><td>I wish for knowledge</td><td>Cross out incorrect evidence in your journal.</td><td>Cursed Hunt, and permanently reduced vision and muffled hearing.</td></tr>
										<tr><td>I wish for anything</td><td>Randomly pick a wish.</td></tr>
